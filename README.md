# RomCom

## Overview

Our app generates fun romantic/silly book covers. You can randomize your covers or create your own.

You can view and play with the application [here](https://philalewis.github.io/romcom/)

View instructions below!

## How does it work?

#### 1) On page load you will see a randomized book cover. You can use the `show new random cover` to create new random covers, save the cover that is shown, view your saved covers and even click the `make your own cover` button to get creative.

#### 2) When you click the `make your own cover` button you will be directed to a form page where you can input your own photos, titles, and descriptions! Then click `make book` to see your work of art.

#### 4) To view all saved covers and delete the ones you don't want, click the `view saved covers` button and you will see a display of all covers. To delete, double click on the photo you do not want.
